    Explanation:

The mutant is buggy because the *useIdentityHashCode* parameter in mutant's code receives a *false* value as the expression *(useIdentityHashCode && false)* always evaluates to a false value regardless of the value assigned to *useIdentityHashCode* parameter. This is due to logical working of the *AND (&&)* operator.

On the contrary, the same function *setUseIdentityHashCode* in the original code receives a different value for its parameter depending on the value of *useIdentityHashCode* which could either be *true* or *false*
