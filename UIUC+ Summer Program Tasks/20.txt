Explanation:

The mutant is buggy because it breaks the *chaining* capability *FormElement* objects. 

In original version, when an *Element* is added to the list of elements in a form, it would return the updated form by returning *this (current instance)*.

The mutant breaks this functionality by returning *null* instead. This would force the programmer to always refer back to original instance in the code to get an updated form, which is unintuitive and less ergonomic.
