Code:

Explanation:

The *java.lang.Object*'s *toString()* method is supposed to be overridden by child classes to offer textual representation of their objects. 

Here, the mutant changes an opening parenthesis "(" to an underscore "-" which doesn't affect the logic (or behaviour) of the code but the computing string can be inconvenient to read.

In light of the bug definition: 

"a bug as a syntactic change that will also change the output and behavior of the code"

The output does change but behavior remains the same, so I don't think it's a bug.
