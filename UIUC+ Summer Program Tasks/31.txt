Explanation:

The mutant is not buggy because the *serializeValue* method isnide *XmlSerializerProvider* class defines *value* to be of *Object* type, which means it can take on any value as long as it's derived from java.lang.Object.

The mutant basically intercepts this value and checks if it's of *String* type, and then converts it into an *Integer* which is essentially a sub-type of *Object*, therefore it can be passed to *serializeValue* method without any problem.

The Jackson (parsing library) should have defined a specialized internal serializer that handles values of *Integer* type. 

The mutant does not introduce any bugs, but some redundant code.
