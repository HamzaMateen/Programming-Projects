Explanation:

In mutant's version, the following line:

_isCData = (isCData == null) ? false : isCData.booleanValue();

is changed into: 

_isCData = (isCData == null) ? _isAttribute : isCData.booleanValue();

Replacing the value *false* by *_isAttribute* is syntactically correct because it's also a *boolean* type, but it would likely result in a bug because there's no apparent relation between a permanent *false* value and *_isAttribute* variable as these are independent pieces of information. Hence, one can't be replaced by another.

This code also implies that if *_isText* happens to be *null*, it would be assigned the value of *_isAttribute*, which is undesired dependency of orthogonal variables.
