Explanation:

The mutant code sets *1 value greater* than the intended *radius* provided by the caller, therefore it should be considered a bug.

For example, if the user wants smallest possible "radius" for the dial by passing *1* for "radius" parameter, but the mutant would still set the radius to *2*, which could be bigger than expected. The caller could pass *0* to account for this, but that would trigger an "IllegalArgumentException". 

The mutant simply breaks the intended functionality of the *setRadius* method. This is off-by-one error.
