Explanation:
// reference method declaration:
// computeInterpolatedStateAndDerivatives(mapper, time, theta, thetaH, oneMinusThetaH)

Elaboration:

Changing the order in which the arguemnts are passed to *computeInterpolatedStateAndDerivatives* will likely result in incorrect behaviour or introduce bugs into code.

While the arguments *equationsMapper*, and *time* have been passed correctly, changing the order of rest would result in generation of incorrect interpolated value for a set of *globalPreviousState* and *globalCurrentState*.

The method expects *theta* to be the normalized distance from starting time to interpolation time, but instead it receives the total difference of previous and current states.

similarly, for *thetaH*, the unnormalized time difference of starting time and interpolation time is expected, but rather, normalized difference *theta* is provided. 

This also holds true for last arguement where *thetaH* is provided instead of *oneMinusThetaH*.

Since *computeInterpolatedStateAndDerivatives*'s implementation is delegated to concrete classes, it'd be a bug if an abstract class uses its own method in a wrong way. End user functionality would be compromised.
