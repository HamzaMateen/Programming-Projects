Explanation:

The *Charset* class supports multiple character sets, for example: US-ASCII, ISO-8859-1, UTF-8, UTF-16BE, UTF-16, UTF-16.

The *getCharsetName()* method in original code would return the name of the current *charset* selected, which could be any of the above.

The mutant changes this by always returning the name of 7 bit charset, that is "US-ASCII" for each invocation regardless of the *actual* charset chosen.
