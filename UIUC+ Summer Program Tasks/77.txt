Explanation:

The mutant introduces a bug by changing the *getCurrentName()* method to throw a *checked exception*. This would force the downstream code to either handle the exception using a *try-catch* block or *propagate* it by declaring it in the method signature. 

This changes original behavior of the code and would require manual refactoring in the calling function.
