Explanation:

The mutant introduces a bug because in mutant's *withIndent()* method, the second argument to FormattingStyle's constructor is a null value.

Elaboration:

The *withIndent()* method constructs a new instance of *FormattingStyle* class. This class' constructor *requires* its arguments to be *non-null*. If any of them happens to be a null value, the constructor would throw the *NullPointerException* exception and fail at runtime.

Moreover, the *indent* string is passed to the *newLine* parameter, which is also not correct because *newLine* parameter only accepts strings of the form: "[\r\n]*". In case early termination hadn't occurred due to the null argument, this problem would have also crashed the program.

The *withIndent()* method should be creating a well-formatted style with existing newline and the providied indent string.
