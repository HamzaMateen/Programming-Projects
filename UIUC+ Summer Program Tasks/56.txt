Explanation:

The *BitSet* *toString()* method returns a string showing all *set* bit positions in a BitSet. It displays these positions as comma-separated numbers, in lowest to highest order e.g., "{0, 2, 5}"

The original version returned this string as-is but the mutant changes that, and now it returns *null* instead. This breaks Java's Object contract for *toString()* which is a fundamental method inherited from *Object* class. The contract for *toString()* suggests that the returned string must contain useful information about the object. 

The mutant breaks this contract which could lead to *NullPointerException*s, concatenation problems where a string is expected etc.

Hence this mutant is buggy.
