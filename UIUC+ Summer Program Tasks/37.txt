Explanation:

Returning "nth-last-child" instead of "nth-child* would introduce a behaviour change because now, the *getPseudoClass* method would return a value that would reverse the direction of pseudo classes in which they are searched and returned down the line.

in CSS, "nth-child(3)" selects the would select the 3rd element from a list of pseudo classes, but "nth-last-child(3)" would select the 3rd last child starting from the end.
