Explanation:

The mutant is not buggy because the expression *(iZone.isFixed() && true)* would still evaluate to whatever value is returned by *isFixed()*. 

The logical AND (&&) only evaluates to *true* if both operands are true. Since, 2nd operand is always true (&& true), the result depends on *iZone.isFixed()*'s value.
