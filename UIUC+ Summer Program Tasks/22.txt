Explanation:
The mutant should be buggy because returning a *null* value instead of a valid next element from the iterator when *next* is called, is neither correct nor intended behaviour.

Apart from that, this would also break the *chaining* functionality where multiple *next()* calls are chained together to retrieve an element by skipping intermediate elements.
