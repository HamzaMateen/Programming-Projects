Explanation:

The mutant would be buggy for a few reasons:

Firstly, it breaks the *documentation* because it says that *sha3_512(final String date)* should produce SHA3_512 hashes for a given input. But with this change, it would not.

Secondly, the mutant would generate a shorter (256 bits) hash which is inherently less powerful, as opposed to the intended SHA3_512 512 bits long hash. Even if this code is passed into production because it *works*, it would not serve its intended purpose.
