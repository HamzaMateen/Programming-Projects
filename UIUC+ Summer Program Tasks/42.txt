Explanation:

The change int mutant should result in a bug. The condition *bytesRead != BoundedSeekableByteChannelInputStream.MAX_BUF_LEN) || (bytesRead != 0* will always evaluate to true because value of *byteRead* can't be both *MAX_BUF_LEN* (8192) or *0* simulatenously. 

It's not equivalent to the original condition: *bytesRead >= 0*, which evaluates to false when no bytes are remaining to be read (bytesRemaining <= 0), indicating end of the buffer.

When end-of-stream is encountered by *read()* function above, it returns -1. The check in original version checked for this -1 to prevent reading when buffer was empty.

But as the check introduced by mutant always evaluates to true, including when *bytesRead == -1*, it allows invlaid buffer reads and breaks end-of-stream handling.
