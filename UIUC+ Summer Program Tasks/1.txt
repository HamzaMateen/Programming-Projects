In original code, the expression inside 'if-statement' evaluates to 'true' if the '_value' holds a reference to any of the sub-classes of the 'Number' such as Double, Float, Integer etc. 

Since we classify a bug as a behavioral or output change introduced via syntax change; the mutant example does just that by restricting the '_value' reference type to 'Integer' only. 

For example: in the former example; 'asInt' method  would return a rounded '3' if a float value of '3.3' was referenced by '_value', while the mutant example would return the 'defaultValue' as the 'if-statement' would be evaluate to false.
