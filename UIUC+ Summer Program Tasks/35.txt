Explanation:

We know that Java's * Integer.MIN_VALUE = -2147483648 *. 
In original version, this value is added to whatever *identityHashCode* values is returned for *CollectionPointer* object, therefore, addition of most negative number (MIN_VALUE) and a positive (identity hash code) would result in a consistent identity value, that represents the object uniquely.

In mutant's version, this MIN_VALUE is subtracted from the hash code, which essentially means it's added to it because subtraction of a -ve value turns into an addtion, so:

identityHashCode(collection) - (-2147483648) 

becomes:

identityHashCode(collection) + 2147483648

a 32 bit integer can't represent 2147483648, therefore it wraps around and avoids overflow, ending up the same value as in the original version.

Therefore, this change likely doesn't introduce any bugs to the code original and behaves the same by managing to represent different CollectionPointer objects with unique hash codes.
