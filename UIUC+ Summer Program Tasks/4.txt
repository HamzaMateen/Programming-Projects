good discussion here on 'final' keyword in JAVA

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/500508/why-should-i-use-the-keyword-final-on-a-method-parameter-in-java

*never reassign arguments* - it's a good programming practice.

Explanation:

The mutant isn't buggy because the step of making a *value* upper case by passing it through *toUpperCase* method ignores non-alphabetic values. For example, a *value = "123!"* remains the same *123!* after being transformed into upper case, therefore, this step functions as an invariant and doesn't change the result. 

As long as *value* is well-formed numerical string [*1] , it would be parsed to a double effectively regardless if it is converted to its upper case or not. 

[*1]: By well-formed numerical string I suppose that it consists of numbers only, and doesn't have a scientific-notation representation, for that would perhaps contain alphanumeric values.
