Explanation:

The mutan't isn't buggy because it just adds a redundant check: *(_annotations.size() >= 0)*. This must be true when checking whether an annotation exists for a class (cls) within *_annotations* map or not.

This check is redundant because it asserts that when checking for an annotation, the size of *_annotations* map must be 0 or any positive size which is always the case. As, a *HashMap* by definition cannot have a -ve size.
