Explanation:

The mutant is buggy because the library should fail to compile now.

The *nextFloat* method actually calls an overloaded method of the same name which expects a starting and an ending range of the form *[start, end)*. 

It requires that both range values must be *non-negative*, in order to return a valid pseudorandom float value back. But this is not the case anymore in the mutant's code. 

The arguments passed to the method is *Float.MinValue* for both range values which is a -ve value (-149), therefore, it should result in a compilation failure.

relevant code:

public static float nextFloat(final float startInclusive, final float endExclusive) {
        Validate.isTrue(endExclusive >= startInclusive,
                "Start value must be smaller or equal to end value.");
        Validate.isTrue(startInclusive >= 0, "Both range values must be non-negative.");
