Explanation:

Passing a *null* to the first predicate's *evaluate* method would result in *undefined behavior* because it depends on how it is defined to handle a null argument. 

It could return *true*, *false* or may even throw exceptions in case *evaluate* has a *null-unsafe* implementation. The interface function itself doesn't forbid passing of a *null* value to it.

This changes the *OrPredicate*'s behaviour, as it's not reliably evaluating both predicates for the passed object, therefore, it's a bug.
