Explanation:

Before mutation, the *minusMillis* was capable of both subtracting and adding *milli seconds* from/to the current *LocalTime* instant. The method basically subtracted the provided *millis*. If negative count was provided, it would become subtracting a negative value which essentially is additon. 
The *minusMillis* method uses *subtract()* from *DurationField*: 

public long subtract(long instant, int value) {
    if (value == Integer.MIN_VALUE) {
        return subtract(instant, (long) value);
    }
    return add(instant, -value);
}

The last line basically negates the provided *millis* value to achieve this. 

The mutant's change alters this behaviour, by ignoring negative values of *millis*, thereby restricting the method to only be capable of "subtracting" milli seconds from the "LocalTime" instant. It won't be able to *add* any durations to current instant through -ve values for milli.

This change of behaviour would render the mutant buggy.
