Explanation:

The mutant's version is not buggy, because it is functionally equivalent to original version.

Instead of comparing the enum *TokenType*'s variants *type* and *TypeToken.EOF* directly, it now just compares their string representation to determine whether the token is an *EOF (end of file)* or not. 

We can get the string representation of an enum's variant through the *toString()* method.

Note: 
In Java, the == operator compares if two variables refer to the same underlying *object*. In mutant's case, this always evaluates to true because both *type.toString()* and *TokenType.EOF.toString()* calls return the same instance's property: *name*. Therefore, toString() can be used here, even if it's not very conventional. For safety sake, the *equals* method can be used for string content comparison instead.
