Explanation:

The original and simple conditional check is configured into a *compound* one comprising two checks *ORed (||)* together.

The mutant has a couple of issues this time.

Firstly, a semantic error has been introduced by replacing *sample2* and *length* with out of context variables named *two* and *length*, respectively. These variables are neither declared nor imported in current file. This should result in a *compilation* failure.

Secondly, the condition *!(length < 0)* is logically invalid. It implies that as long as length is *non-negative*, the exception *DimensionMismatchException* should be thrown, which basically reverses the logic of the original code.
