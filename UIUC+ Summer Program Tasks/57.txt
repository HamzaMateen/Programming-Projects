Explanation:

Backdrop:
The *incrementAnnoN()* method in original version increments the annotation count for the last annotation type registered within a *band*.
It doesn't accept any *index* argument because it's designed for a workflow where annotations are added incrementally to elements attached to the *band*s within a *context*.

I derived this from the following code snippet where this method is used: 

if (visible) {
    // add annotation to the current band group.
    class_RVA_bands.addAnnotation(desc, nameRU, tags, values, caseArrayN, nestTypeRS, nestNameRU, nestPairN);

    // If the class already has this annotation, increase the count. [21th flag being set somehow indicates this.]

    if ((class_flags[index] & (1 << 21)) != 0) {
        class_RVA_bands.incrementAnnoN();
    } 
    else { // if this is the first annotation, create new entry with count 1
        class_RVA_bands.newEntryInAnnoN();
        class_flags[index] = class_flags[index] | (1 << 21);
    }
}

So in light of above discussion, the mutant qualifies as buggy because the *incrementAnnoN()* method now increments the count of *first* annotation type encountered instead of the most recently added annotation type.
