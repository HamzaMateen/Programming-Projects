Explanation:

The original function would throw *NullPointerException* implicitly anyway because it doesn't handle or catch it explicitly in try-catch block.

The mutant only makes it explicit by placing a *null* check for the input string, however, it still throws the same *NullPointerException* exception. 

In this way, the mutant is "not" buggy since no behaviour change happened.
