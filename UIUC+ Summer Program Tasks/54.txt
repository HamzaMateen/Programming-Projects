Explanation:


The *isNextChar* method checks whether the next character following the given position *index* in a *StringBuilder* matches a specified character *c*.

In mutant's modified version of *isNextChar* method, if either the input *index < 0* or *index >= (builder.length -1)*, then it would return *true* instead of *false* (as by original version), therefore it's a bug. When the index is out of these bounds, this method's output would incorrectly indicate a match for the input character *c*.

On the contrary, if the mutant's version gets to evaluate the *if* condition, then the output is completely determined by the expression present inside it, and would be the same as original. 

Hence, the output would be incorrect when the index is out of these bounds. It could result in a logical error in the calling code.
