Explanation:

The change introduced in the mutant would result in a compilation failure. 

Elaboration:

In original version, the *getCodec()* method would have returned the stored *_objectCodec* if it was called on a derived class.

But the following line introduced in the mutant:

return _objectCodec == null ? null : _objectCodec.treeCodec();

calls a *hypothetical* method *treeCodec()* on *_objectCodec* object when it's not null (injected by downstream extender). This method does not exist in either of abstract classes be that *ObjectCodec* or be it the one it extends called *TreeCodec*. None of these abstract classes declare this method. Therefore, it would result in a comple time error.
