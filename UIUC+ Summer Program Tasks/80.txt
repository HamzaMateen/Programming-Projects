Explanation:

In Java, data loss would occur if converting from *double* to *int*. This is because *double* can represent fractional values, and very large/small values due to its sheer size of 64-bit as opposed to 32-bit size of int.

The mutated version first converts the provided *double* data to an *int* which would get rid of the fractional part (3.141 -> 3) or if it's too large a number, then it would be reduced maximum representable number by an int, that is, *Integer.MAX_VALUE* to fit into that data type. This data loss would lead to bugs that where precise values are needed to be passed to the *setIntervalPositionFactor(double)* method. 

The code won't crash because Java promotes narrow datatype values (int) to wider data type values automatically, therefore the int *i* would be cast to a *double* automatically when passing it to the method in question.

Hence, this mutant is buggy.
