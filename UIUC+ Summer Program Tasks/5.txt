Explanation:

TL;DR:

boolean matchRawType = exactType.getType() == exactType.getRawType();
matchRawType && exactType.getType() == type.getRawType()

is equivalent to: 

matchRawType = true
matchRawType && exactType.getType() == type.getRawType()

END_TL;DR

Reasoning:

It wasn't obvious from the surface whether making *matchRawType = true* would have any effects on the code or not, so I had to dig deeper. 

In the code, *matchRawType* is being passed to *SingleTypeFactory*'s constructor; which in turn basically assigns it, internally, as-is to a variable. 

CODE: 

SingleTypeFactory(Object typeAdapter, TypeToken<?> exactType, boolean matchRawType, Class<?> hierarchyType) {
      ...
      ... 
      this.exactType = exactType;
      this.matchRawType = matchRawType; <--- HERE
      this.hierarchyType = hierarchyType;
    } 

END_CODE

Since, we are returning this *TypeAdapterFactory*, it is reasonable to think that it gets used to create *TypeAdapter*s, which is exactly what its *create* method does. 

The *TypeAdapterFactory* features a *create* method, that implements how an adapter for a certain *Type* object is created. 

The *create* method contains the follow LOC:

CODE:
...
...
boolean matches = exactType != null
          ? exactType.equals(type) || matchRawType && exactType.getType() == type.getRawType()
          : hierarchyType.isAssignableFrom(type.getRawType());
END_CODE:

Here, *matchRawType* is basically used to control the assertion of whether the passed *exactType* has the same *Raw Type* and *Full Type*. This is to prevent creation of adapters for granular types by ignoring parameterized types of generics, such as, List<String> or List<Integer>, therefore, only creating adapters for base class i.e *List.class*
