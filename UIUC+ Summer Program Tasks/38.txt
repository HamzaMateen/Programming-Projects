Explanation:

The mutant is buggy and should result in a *compilation* failure.

Explanation:
In the copy-constructor of *StdValueInstatiator* class, a non-existentent member variable *src.type* is being accessed through the *src* parameter at line 100, which actually isn't defined anywhere within the *StdValueInstatiator* class.

The *StdValueInstatiator* extends the *ValueInstantiator* class which also doesn't declare any member named *type*, so it couldn't be inherited from there.

Even the *Serializable* interface implemented by the class is a *marker* interface which doesn't expose any variables whatsoever, therefore, the *type* couldn't be exposed from there either.

Hence, this would result in a compile-time error stating that the variable *type* wasn't found.
