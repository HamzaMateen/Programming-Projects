Explanation:

The *toString* method for the *Comment* tag should return a valid HTML comment. The mutant alters the string representation produced by the *toString* method, meaning a proper comment won't be returned.

If we check the *toString* method implementation of other tags such as **StartTag**, **EndTag**, etc., it's clear that the *toString* method is used to wrap a token's content inside an appropriate string.

The mutant compromises this for the **Comment** tag by changing the padding strings from ["<!--", "-->"] to ["<", "-->"], which doesn't represent an HTML comment.
