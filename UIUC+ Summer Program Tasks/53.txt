Explanation:

The mutant is buggy because it changes the *encodeString(byte[])* method in such a way that it would always return a *null* for every byte array passed to it.

This method internally invokes *StringUtils.newStringUtf8()*, which returns the UTF-8 encoded string asscociated with the byte array or returns *null* if the input is *null*. This basically means that even valid byte arrays would result in a null return value, which might lead to *NullPointerException*s where this method is used.
