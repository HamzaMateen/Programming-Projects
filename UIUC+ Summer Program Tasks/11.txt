Explanation:

This one seems tricky to me. I re-state the definition of a *bug* for my argument's sake:

bug: 
We define a bug as a syntactic change that will also change the output and behavior of the code. (from the provided manual)

in the mutant's version, the *hash* is multiplied with a constant int of value 31, which certainly changes the output of the method *hash32*, from the original version, but it doesn't change the computation behavior of the code. It will always provide a unique *hash* for a unique *byte array*, therefore, I don't think it's a bug. 

Also, *MurmurHash32* class isn't intended for cryptographic purposes but rather for *general hash-based loopkups*, so it shouldn't be much of a deal I believe.
