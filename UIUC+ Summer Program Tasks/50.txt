Explanation:

The mutant's version doesn't seem buggy because even though each hash generated by *hashCode()* method is now incremented by 1, the overall hash generation functionality isn't broken. The hashes are still generated in same way as before and would remain consistent in an isolated setting. They would generate *same* hashes for collections that contain *same elements in same order*.

Only in one case would these be broken; if a list had been hashed with original version and then the same list's hash were compared with the hash calculated through mutant's version of *hashCode()*. Because, that would result in a hash *mismatch*. This is to say that, this change breaks *interoperability* but remains consistent in isolation.

Supporting reverse claim: 

The mutant's version actually introduces a bug because each hash generated by *hashCode()* method is now incremented by 1.
The hash is no more generated in the same way as before, and would lead to a hash *mismatch* if a list had been hashed with the original version of *hashCode()* and then the same list's hash were compared with the hash calculated through the mutant's version of *hashCode()*.

The method would still generate *same* hashes for collections that contain *same elements in same order*, but only within an isolated setting, and would only be forward compatible.

This is to say that, the overall hash generation functionality is going to be consistent, but it is broken from a *interoperability* perspective.
