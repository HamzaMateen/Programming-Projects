explanation:

It seems like the mutant introduces a bug by changing in the "if" statement from *(value instanceof Stroke)* to *(cellHasFocus)*. 

The *getListCellRendererComponent(...)* method returns a renderer for a *stroke* sample. This implies that this method would always return a *Component (renderer in this case)* for *each* cell that features a different *Stroke* sample based on the provided value. 
This method isn't supposed to return a sample ONLY when the cell is being *focused* because that would omit all other choices from the list being rendered which the user can choose their stroke sample from.

The *cellHasFocus* argument could be used for a different purpose such as changing the background color of the cell or a pop up effect (if possible) or changing border color.

Next, although the change is syntactically sound, yet it might result in a runtime crash when the *value* of *Object* doesn't turn out to be an *instanceof* of *Stroke*, and thenceforth, not castable into *Stroke* type. Which could trigger *ClassCastException*.

Answer (to my Task #70):

The mutant should be buggy because it wouldn't add the "length" of first element value, that is, "elementValue[0]" since the loop skips the first index by starting from "i = 1" instead of "i = 0" as in original.
