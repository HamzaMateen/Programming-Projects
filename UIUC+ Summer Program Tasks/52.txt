Explanation:
The mutant's *getInstance(NameType)* would always return *null* instead of the corresponding value for *NameType* key, therefore the mutant is buggy. 

Elaboration:

The static member *LANGUAGES* is of *EnumMap* type. It is a specialized and efficient map type in Java unlike the more general type called *HashMap*. It only accepts enum objects as its key type. 

The *get(key)* method is defined to return the corresponding *value* of a *key* or *null* if a key doesn't exist in an EnumMap but in mutant's version, passing the *null* value to the *get* method would always return null [docs].

Since the *getInstance(NameType)* method woudn't work reliably or in an expected manner by not returning the corresponding values for a passed key, this mutant is buggy.
 
[docs] Null keys are not permitted. Attempts to insert a null key will throw NullPointerException. "Attempts to test for the presence of a null key or to remove one will, however, function properly". [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/EnumMap.html]
