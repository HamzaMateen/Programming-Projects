Explanation:

The mutant is not buggy because it just adds a redundant check (flags != other.flags) that is ORed (||) with the pre-existing condition. OR (||) returns true if either of the cases is true.

This condition to check if both objects have the same flags already takes place down in the body of *equals()*, so in the mutant's version, it would only cause an earlier return if the objects' flags wouldn't match.
