Explanation:

The *TokenStreamFactory* is an *abstract* class that can't be instantiated, which by extension requires that its non-static member methods must be abstract as well, whose implementation would be provided by sub classes that extend it.

The original version *declares* an abstract member method called *JsonParser(Reader r)* and doesn't provide its definition, therefore it's valid.

The mutant provides a *definition* too in addition to the *declaration* of this method which is syntactically wrong and would lead to failed compilation of the library.
