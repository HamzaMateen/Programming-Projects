Explanation:

The mutant is buggy because it compromises the intended functionality of *getOuter()* method which is used to extract *outer* class name from a *Fully Qualified Class Name (FQCN)*. 

In Java, a FCQN comprises the *Outer* and *Inner* class names concatenated together with $ character.

*getOuter()* uses $ sign as a delimeter to extract all but deepest class' name and returns it back as a String.

The mutaint version changes that. It uses a dot (.) as a delimiter instead of $ which is wrong because now, the code would use the index of last occurring dot in a FQCN, and return everything present before it.

For example; If we have an FQCN for a class, such as:

FQCN:   java.util.Map$Entry
Inner:  Entry
Outer:  java.util.Map

In this manner:

Mutant returns *java.util* because the last dot occurs before *Map*.

*getOuter()* method would return *java.util.Map* for original implementation.
